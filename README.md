Import the files and merge them into a single dataset.
Conducted exploratory steps including any visuals to describe the dataset.
Create a model to predict the binary categorical variable named “target” including:
A methodology for variable selection.
A methodology to determine whether and to what level the model is over-fit.
An analysis of: Most Important variables, Direction of effect of the variables, quality of the fit.
created visualizations to explain the model to business users.
Each record has a small piece of textual data associated with it in the text field. Transformed that textual data into variables and improved the quality model.
Spam detection classification model consist of multiple models and comparing and optimizing Decision Tree and Logistic Regression using curves, Performed Feature selection using Random Forest model and selected 20 most important features out of 600 fields.
